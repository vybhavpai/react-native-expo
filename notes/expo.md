### File-Based Navigation

Expo provides a powerful file-based routing system that simplifies navigation setup:

1. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   app/
   ├── _layout.tsx      # Root layout configuration
   ├── index.tsx        # Home screen (/)
   ├── profile.tsx      # Profile screen (/profile)
   └── settings/
       ├── _layout.tsx  # Settings layout
       └── index.tsx    # Settings screen (/settings)
   ```

2. **Key Features**
   - Automatic route generation based on file structure
   - Nested navigation through folder structure
   - Layout files (`_layout.tsx`) for shared UI elements
   - Dynamic routes with `[param]` syntax
   - Type-safe navigation with TypeScript

3. **Benefits**
   - No manual route configuration needed
   - Intuitive file organization
   - Easy to maintain and scale
   - Built-in type safety
   - Automatic code splitting

### Navigation in Expo

#### Route Groups
Route groups are a powerful feature in Expo Router that help organize related screens without affecting the URL structure:

1. **Syntax**
   - Folders wrapped in parentheses `()` are route groups
   - Example: `(tabs)`, `(auth)`, `(modals)`
   - The group name is not included in the URL

2. **Example Structure**
   ```
   app/
   ├── (tabs)/           # Group for tab navigation
   │   ├── index.tsx    # URL: /
   │   └── profile.tsx  # URL: /profile
   └── (auth)/          # Group for auth screens
       └── login.tsx    # URL: /login
   ```

3. **Benefits**
   - Clean URLs (no group names in the path)
   - Better organization of related screens
   - Shared layouts for grouped screens
   - Multiple index files in different groups
   - Logical grouping of features

4. **Common Use Cases**
   - `(tabs)` - For tab-based navigation
   - `(auth)` - For authentication-related screens
   - `(modals)` - For modal screens
   - `(drawer)` - For drawer navigation screens
